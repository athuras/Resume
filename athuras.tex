\section{Hi There!}
\cvline{}{\Large I find patterns and solve problems.}
\cvline{}{
\small I'm continually seeking \textbf{interesting}, and \textbf{challenging} work, with people who share that goal.
I have a broad collection of experience that spans industries and disciplines with a recent focus on scientific and systems programming.

\section{Experience}
\subsection{Work}
\cventry{August 2014 -}{Twitter Inc.}{Software Engineer}{San Francisco, CA}{}{
  As part of the Ads Analytics Infrastructure team, I've worked on advertising campaign forecasting, a rate limiter for a large distributed system, and a specialized sampling search engine.
  I've also worked on the engagement counter: the analytics system powering Twitter's ads reporting products.
  I've written numerous Scalding jobs, and substantially contributed to many production systems that are deployed to thousands of nodes, and are revenue critical.
  I worked primary in \textbf{Scala}, \textbf{Java} and \textbf{Python}; and developed an addition to functional programming.
}

\cventry{Spring 2013}{Facebook Inc.}{Product Analytics Intern}{Menlo Park, CA}{}{
	I conducted \textbf{quantitative analysis}, and \textbf{designed statistical experiments} for the Notifications and Messages teams.
  Beyond interfacing with engineers and product managers, I additionally worked with the BI team---writing large data pipelines in \textbf{Hadoop} with \textbf{Hive}.
  My most significant contribution was a large refactor/redesign of a legacy reporting pipeline---the result ran an order of magnitude faster, using 20\% of the resources.
}

\cventry{Fall 2012}{Magnetic Inc.}{Data Engineer}{New York City, NY}{}{
	I built ad-performance reporting, data processing, and modelling pipelines leveraging \textbf{Hadoop, Pig, AWS} and various flavors of \textbf{Python}.
	Additionally, I built some NLP tools targeted at assessing search data quality. All of which are happily operating in production.
}

\cventry{Winter 2012}{SkyGrid Inc.}{Software Engineering Intern}{Sunnyvale CA}{}{
	As part of a small team I wore many hats. I contributed to the iOS codebase for Touchtv, a social TV app for iPad wherein I was responsible for Facebook and Twitter integration.
}

\cventry{Spring 2011, Fall 2010}{ITG Canada Inc.}{Trading System/Compliance Analyst}{Toronto ON}{}{
	During my first 4-month block at ITG, I used a combination of Excel, SQL, VBA and Ruby to provide meaningful data analysis and create historical models of ITG's trading activity.
	During my second block, I independently completely overhauled the existing trade compliance infrastructure in \textbf{SQL}---automating away the business case for hiring me in the first place.
}

\subsection{Projects}
\cventry{2013-2014}{Relay: Adaptive Traffic Control}{SYDE 4B Design Project}{}{}{
	Traffic is a major problem in almost all cities, and adaptive traffic control systems work quite well in most environments---but they are notoriously expensive.
	We designed a distributed, geographically de-centralized traffic control system composed of single-intersection agents married to a modern traffic visualization application.
	In concert, all agents in the system partially coordinate to generate a large distributed predictive model of macro-traffic patterns.
	I designed the control systems, network architecture, and incentive structures used in the project.
  The actors in the system (implemented in \textbf{Erlang/OTP}) operated as dynamic graph automata with consensus filters for loose synchroneity.
}

\cventry{Winter 2014}{Attention: English Accent Classification}{Research/Vision Quest}{}{}{
	English Speach recognition is a difficult problem, particularly given the wide gamut of accents.
  Using a variety of signal processing techniques, as well as online clustering, I developed a system which can classify whether a speaker is a native to the language.
  The system was written in \textbf{Python} making extensive use of \textbf{SciKit Learn}, and \textbf{NumPy}.
}

\cventry{Winter 2013}{divie: Friendly Asset Division}{SYDE 3B Design Project}{Waterloo ON}{}{
	Divie is a generalised auction/assignment platform targeted at division-of-asset scenarios (such as divorce).
  Each user allocates a fixed budget towards items in a silent-auction-like manner.
  I architected the system, and designed an algorithm which distributes auction items so that the variance of loss across the stakeholders is minimized.
  The application was powered by \textbf{Flask, PostgresSQL}, and \textbf{Heroku}.
}

\cventry{Fall 2012}{BufferBox Lock Addressing}{BufferBox Inc.}{Waterloo ON}{}{
	In partnership with BufferBox (YC'12)---a Waterloo-based logistics and delivery company (acquired by Google), we implemented the hardware aspect of the BufferBox platform using open-source components and software (Arduinos and LAMP). I worked primarily in \textbf{C++}.}
