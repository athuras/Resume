\section{Hi There!}
\cvline{}{\Large I find patterns and solve problems.}
\cvline{}{
\small I'm continually seeking \textbf{interesting}, and \textbf{challenging} work, with people who share that goal.
I have a broad collection of experience that spans industries and disciplines, with a recent focus in scientific programming within the domain of internet advertising.

\section{Experience}
\subsection{Work}
\cventry{August 2014 -}{Twitter Inc.}{Software Engineer}{San Francisco, CA}{}{
  On the Ads Analytics team, I work on advertiser-facing infrastructure that predicts campaign efficacy. I also design tools for automated system characterisation (statistical or otherwise).
}

\cventry{Spring 2013}{Facebook Inc.}{Product Analytics Intern}{Menlo Park, CA}{}{
	I conducted \textbf{quantitative analysis}, and \textbf{designed statistical experiments} for the Notifications and Messages teams.
  Beyond interfacing with engineers and product managers, I additionally worked with the BI team---writing large data pipelines in \textbf{Hadoop} with \textbf{Hive}.
  My most significant contribution was a large refactor/redesign of a legacy reporting pipeline---the result ran an order of magnitude faster, using 20\% of the resources.
}

\cventry{Fall 2012}{Magnetic Inc.}{Data Engineer}{New York City, NY}{}{
	I built ad-performance reporting, data processing, and modelling pipelines leveraging \textbf{Hadoop, Pig, AWS} and various flavors of \textbf{Python}.
	Additionally, I built some NLP tools targeted at assessing search data quality. All of which are happily operating in production.
}

\cventry{Winter 2012}{SkyGrid Inc.}{Software Engineering Intern}{Sunnyvale CA}{}{
	As part of a small team I wore many hats. I contributed to the iOS codebase for Touchtv, a social TV app for iPad wherein I was responsible for Facebook and Twitter integration.
	However, my most significant project used application-level JavaScript.
}

\cventry{Spring 2011, Fall 2010}{ITG Canada Inc.}{Trading System/Compliance Analyst}{Toronto ON}{}{
	During my first 4-month block at ITG, I used a combination of Excel, SQL, VBA and Ruby to provide meaningful data analysis and create historical models of ITG's trading activity.
	During my second block, I independently completely overhauled the existing trade compliance infrastructure in \textbf{SQL}---automating away the business case for hiring me in the first place.
  I was also partly responsible for maintaining the backend of MATCH Now: a Canadian dark trading venue, as well as getting on the phone with traders using the platform.
}

\subsection{Projects}
\cventry{2013-2014}{Relay: Adaptive Traffic Control}{SYDE 4B Design Project}{}{}{
	Traffic is a major problem in almost all cities, and adaptive traffic control systems work quite well in most environments---but they are notoriously expensive.
	We designed a distributed, geographically de-centralized traffic control system composed of single-intersection agents married to a modern traffic visualization application.
	In concert, all agents in the system partially coordinate to generate a large distributed predictive model of macro-traffic patterns.
	I designed the control systems, network architecture, and incentive structures used in the project.
  The actors in the system (implemented in \textbf{Erlang/OTP}) operated as dynamic graph automata with consensus filters for loose synchroneity.
}

\cventry{Winter 2014}{Attention: English Accent Classification}{Research/Vision Quest}{}{}{
	English Speach recognition is a difficult problem, particularly given the wide gamut of accents.
  Using a variety of signal processing techniques, as well as online clustering, I developed a system which can decide whether a speaker is a native to the language. The resulting system achieves a cross-validated F1 score of 0.79 using untuned SVMs.
  The system was written in \textbf{Python} making extensive use of \textbf{SciKit Learn}, and \textbf{NumPy}.
}

\cventry{Winter 2013}{divie: Friendly Asset Division}{SYDE 3B Design Project}{Waterloo ON}{}{
	divie is a generalised auction/assignment platform targeted at division-of-asset scenarios (such as divorce).
  Each user allocates a fixed budget towards items in a silent-auction-like manner.
  I architected the system, and designed an algorithm which distributes auction items so that the variance of loss across the stakeholders is minimized.
  The application was powered by \textbf{Flask, PostgresSQL}, and \textbf{Heroku}.
}

\cventry{Fall 2012}{BufferBox Lock Addressing}{BufferBox Inc.}{Waterloo ON}{}{
	In partnership with BufferBox (YC'12)---a Waterloo-based logistics and delivery company (acquired by Google), we implemented the hardware aspect of the BufferBox platform using open-source components and software (Arduinos and LAMP). I worked primarily in \textbf{C++}.}
