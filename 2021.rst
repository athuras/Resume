Experience:
===========
The majority of my professional experience over the last 7 years has been working as a backend engineer within the Revenue organization at Twitter. 
I've worked on a wide variety of projects spanning distributed systems, machine learning, and optimization as an individual contributor, but also as a project, and team lead.
I’ve had an outsized influence on our hiring culture and have conducted over 350 interviews, and working with hiring managers to improve their processes and grow their teams.

**2019 - current**: Sr. ML Software Engineer (Twitter Inc, San Francisco CA)
I improve the efficacy of Twitter’s performance advertising products. 
This includes novel feature and modeling work that has lead to significant improvements to mobile app install metrics (and some that has not). 
I drove a systemic culture shift for project/model ownership and operations within an organization of over 50 engineers. 
I built a quasi-realtime training feed in BigQuery for ad impressions at Twitter, and has become the de-facto standard for training data across the org in GCP.

**2016-2019**: Sr. Software Engineer (Twitter Inc, San Francisco CA)
I worked on a variety of distributed system projects targets at improving the developer/operator experience for our large scale ad serving system. 
This involved experiments in query/client performance within the ad server, introducing and instrumenting new datasets, and jumping in to address several high urgency projects related to data privacy in the context of ad serving.

**2015-2016**: Software Engineer 2 (Twitter Inc, San Francisco CA)
Extending on prior work to include more technical leadership for the forecaster project, as well as an emergency project to rebuild our Brand Surveys product offering from scratch. This involved building up, training, and eventually migrating the new system to a new team in Seattle.

**2014 - 2015**: Software Engineer 1 (Twitter Inc, San Francisco CA)
Work focusing on data engineering for Twitter’s ad’s analytics infrastructure, as well as building a service for campaign performance forecasting.
